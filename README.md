# K-6 DAO

Welcome to the K-6 DAO repository! This repository contains the smart contracts and code for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on K-6 education. The DAO facilitates interactions between students, tutors, and administrators to enhance decentralized learning for elementary school students.

## Contracts

### Student Contract

The `Student` contract allows students to register, select subjects, and access their profile details. It includes functions such as `register` and `selectSubject`. Students can interact with this contract to participate in the K-6 DAO.

### Tutor Contract

The `Tutor` contract allows tutors to register, select subjects, and access their profile details. It includes functions such as `register` and `selectSubject`. Tutors can interact with this contract to offer their tutoring services within the K-6 DAO.

### Administrator Contract

The `Administrator` contract allows administrators to set the main contract, access student and tutor profiles, and edit the DAO code. It includes functions such as `setMainContract`, `accessStudentProfile`, and `editDAOCode`. Administrators can interact with this contract to manage and maintain the K-6 DAO.

### Main Contract

The `MainContract` acts as the central contract that connects the student, tutor, and administrator contracts. It provides functions such as `registerStudent`, `registerTutor`, and `selectSubject` for seamless interaction between the contracts.
